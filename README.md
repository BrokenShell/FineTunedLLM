### NOTES

Embeddings with retrieval is best suited for cases when you need to have a large database of documents with relevant context and information. Retrieval strategies are not an alternative to fine-tuning and can in fact be complementary to it.


### Training Example Count
- Minimum: 10
- Nominal: 50-100
- Expert: 500-1000
- Master: 1000+

### Cost Formula
- c = base cost per 1k tokens 
- n = number of tokens in the input file 
- e = number of epochs trained
- Estimate => c * n * e
- For a training file with 100,000 tokens trained over 3 epochs, the expected cost would be ~$2.40.


### Transform a List[Dict] to JSON-L File
```python

### Create an OpenAI Training File from JSON-L
```python
import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

openai.File.create(file=open("marv.jsonl", "rb"), purpose='fine-tune')
```

### Fine Tune GPT-3.5-turbo
```python
import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

openai.FineTuningJob.create(training_file="file-abc123", model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

### Use Custom GPT Model
```python
import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="ft:gpt-3.5-turbo:my-org:custom_suffix:id",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capitol of Oregon?"}
  ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```
